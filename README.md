MoneyRPC is a minecraft **fabric mod**. It enables you to display your real time balance on the Samifying's HideySMP
Minecraft server

### Prerequisites

Before we get started you need to make sure you have a **Fabric Mod Loader** installed on your client. To dowlonad the
Fabric Mod Loader go to this link here:

- [Fabric Mod Loader Download Page](https://fabricmc.net/use/)

There are a lot of good tutorials online on how to install Fabric so we wont focuse on it in this document. What we will
do is cover the installation of the MoneyRPC mod

Also you will need to have Fabric API mod installed as well. You can download it from this link:

- [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files)

### Installation

Installation of this mod is exactly the same as for any other minecraft mod, all we need to do is download it and drop
it in the corresponding `mods` folder

Navigate to the [download page](https://github.com/SamiCraft/MoneyRPC/releases/latest) and download
the `money-rpc-1.3.jar`. Now open your `.minecraft` folder (or if you are an advanced user open your custom minecraft
directory) and navigate to the `mods` folder. Drop the downloaded `moneyrpc-1.3.jar` and start the game.

Congratulations, you have **successfully** installed the MoneyRPC Fabric mod
